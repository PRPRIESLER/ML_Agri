# ML_Agri
Machine Learning Project: Implementation of Machine learning Algorithms on agricultural Sector to support Farmers with the help of different 
crucial sections of prediction that they require help with for better farming practices. It also helps in the identification of the diseases that might have affected their crops.= using Image detection and disease classification.

Hoping to develop on the current Dataset and also the learning process with better metrics and better prediction module.
Thanks,
Let's keep learning!
